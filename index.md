# Shriansh's First CS193 Homework

### Things that I like so far about CS 193
- Campuswire is a convenient way to ask for help and learn about what else I could do
- The Bay Area crowd in the lecture hall was sick (let's go Bay)
- The instructors are super chill

My basic bash scripting:
```bash
echo "I can't wait to check out LaTex!"
```
